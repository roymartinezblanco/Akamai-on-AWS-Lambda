# Akamai plus AWS Lambda

See my blog on this project in [medium](https://medium.com/@roymartinezblanco/how-to-use-akamai-api-libraries-in-aws-lambda-5204fedc21f3)

This project is designed to an example on how to use [Akamai's](https://www.akamai.com/) [API's](https://developer.akamai.com/api) and [Libraries](https://github.com/akamai) within [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). 

We will do this using an example use case and we will be using the following libraries in Python.

### Libraries
* [NetstorageAPI](https://github.com/akamai/NetStorageKit-Python)
* [Akamai Edgegrid](AkamaiOPEN-edgegrid-python)
* [AWS SDK for Python](https://github.com/boto/boto3)



## Disclaimer
**Keep in mind that is meant to be a sample script to build on top of, it is functional but it by no means cover every single scenario.**
